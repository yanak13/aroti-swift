# Aroti Swift Project Rules

## Project Scope
**CRITICAL: All work MUST be performed within the `~/aroti-swift/` directory and its subdirectories ONLY.**

## Directory Structure
The project consists of:
- `aroti/` - iOS Swift application
- `aroti-backend/` - FastAPI Python backend
- `aroti-infra/` - Kubernetes infrastructure and deployment configs
- `.github/` - GitHub Actions workflows
- `aroti.xcodeproj/` - Xcode project files
- `arotiTests/` - iOS unit tests
- `arotiUITests/` - iOS UI tests

## Rules

1. **Never create files or directories outside `~/aroti-swift/`**
   - Do NOT create files in `~/` (except `~/aroti-swift/`), or any parent directory
   - All new files must be created within the project root or its subdirectories

2. **Path Validation**
   - Always use paths starting with `~/aroti-swift/` or relative paths from the project root
   - When using relative paths, ensure they resolve within the project root
   - Verify paths before creating, reading, or modifying files

3. **Backend Work**
   - All backend code goes in `aroti-backend/`
   - All infrastructure configs go in `aroti-infra/`
   - Never create `aroti-backend` or `aroti-infra` outside the project root

4. **GitHub Workflows**
   - All workflows must be in `.github/workflows/` within the project root
   - Never create workflows in `~/.github/` or other locations

5. **When in Doubt**
   - If a path doesn't start with `~/aroti-swift/` or is relative to the project root, it's wrong
   - Always verify the target directory is within the project before proceeding
   - Ask for clarification if the intended location is unclear

## Project Context
This is a complete iOS application project with:
- SwiftUI frontend (iOS app)
- FastAPI backend (Python)
- Kubernetes infrastructure
- CI/CD pipelines
- All components must remain within the single project directory structure
